    "__Define Open Reproducible Science:__ Open reproduceible science makes the process of scientific research available to all in a way that anyone can access, understand and iterate the process. This allows to share and colaborate the methods,data, and outcomes easily with transparency. Simply, open reproducible science is a way of doing research which others can access,understand and replicate without any boundation. It makes the entire process transparent and ensures that results are available freely. <br><br>\n",

This course provided me to understand and learn hands on python code with applications in Geospatial domain via Git which is shareable, replicable, and available freely."
